# maths-computer-science-project

This is a team work I did during my first year at my engineering school. <br>
With this code, a user enters a word of any length, and the program writes all the permutations possible. <br>
The contraint was to use factorials.

We made a main program where the user can choose different options:
1) Decomposing a number in a sum of prime numbers
2) Write the permutation of a word of 5 letters for a given place
3) Write all the permutations of a word of 5 letters
4) Write the permutation of a word of n letters for a given place
5) Write all the permutations of a word of n letters
6) Find the maximum of a function defined on the whole anagrams
